% Input: V -> 2x2 matrix denoting the process noise in (forward, angular)
%        W -> 2x2 matrix denoting the sensing noise in (range, bearing)
%        x0 -> 3x1 vector denoting the initial vehicle state mean
%        P0 -> 3x3 matrix denoting the initial vehicle state covariance
%        range -> Scalar denoting the maximum range of the sensor
%        fov -> 1x2 vector denoting the [min_bearing, max_bearing]
%               (field of view) that can be detected by the sensor
